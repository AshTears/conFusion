# conFusion

conFusion was the project exercise for the course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4" on Coursera.
The course gave an overview about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. 
At the end of this course, I was able to

b) Create a responsive web page design, and 
c) Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.
