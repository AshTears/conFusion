# conFusion

conFusion was the project exercise for the course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4" on Coursera.
The course gave an overview about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. 
At the end of this course, I was able to 
- Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components, 
- Create a responsive web page design, and 
- Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.

## What I Learned
- Bootstrap 4
- Less and Sass
- NPM
- Task runners: Grunt, Gulp

## Building and Deployment

There are three ways in which you can build and deploy this problem:
** The project deploys to localhost:3000 **

### NPM Scripts

1) In a console prompt, first run `git checkout dc8d478`
2) Then run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules
3) Then run `npm run watch:all` to deploy the project

### Grunt Task Runner
1) In a console prompt, first run `git checkout 9233650`
2) Then run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules
3) Then run `grunt` which will build and deploy the project.

### Gulp Task Runner
1) In a console prompt, first run `git checkout af881a3`
2) Then run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules
3) Then run `gulp` to deploy the project
