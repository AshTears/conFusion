# conFusion

conFusion was the project exercise for the course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4" on Coursera.
The course gave an overview about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. 
At the end of this course, I was able to 
- Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components, 
- Create a responsive web page design, and 
- Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.

## What I Learned
- Bootstrap 4
- Less and Sass
- NPM
- Task runners: Grunt, Gulp
